# StellarSim
StellarSim is an interactive stellar system simulator. It allows you to create and observe the behavior of various celestial bodies (planets, stars, satellites, comets, etc.) under the influence of gravity and other forces

### Main goals

- Create celestial bodies with customizable properties
- Simulate gravity and orbital mechanics
- Real-time 2D visualization
- Interactive menu to explore and modify the stellar systems

### Projecy Purpose
This is a personal, learning-oriented project designed to explore physics simulation, interactive graphics, and system dynamics. A great opportunity to improve skills in development, visualization, and computational modeling.
